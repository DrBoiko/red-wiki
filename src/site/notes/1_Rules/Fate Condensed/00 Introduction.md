This is _**Fate Condensed**_, a version of _**Fate Core System**_ in as compact a form as we can manage. It is a complete roleplaying game; while other books might enhance your use of it, you don’t need any other book to play.

On that note, let’s get into what you _do_ need!

# What do I need to play?
To play _**Fate Condensed**_ you’ll need two to six friends with one acting as Game Master (GM), some dice, some tokens, writing implements, paper, and something to write short notes on (_e.g.,_ small “sticky notes”).

_**Fate Condensed**_ uses **Fate Dice™** when characters take action. Fate dice are six-sided dice with two :FiFateZero: sides, two :FiFatePlus: sides, and two :FiFateMinus: sides. One set of four dice will work fine, but one set per player is ideal. Other alternatives exist, such as using standard six-sided dice (1-2 = :FiFateMinus:, 3-4 = :FiFateZero:, 5-6 = :FiFatePlus:), or the **Deck of Fate**, which uses cards instead of dice. We use the word “roll” throughout the text for simplicity.

## For Veterans: Changes From Fate Core
Condensing the gist of a system from nearly 300 pages down to about 50 pages of text does lead to a few changes. As of this writing it has also been eight years since _**Fate Core System**_ was created, so a little iteration of the design is to be expected. In particular, we highlight the following:

- We’ve shifted over to [one-point stress boxes](https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed/challenges-conflicts-and-contests#stress) to help reduce confusion.
- [“Balsera Style” initiative](https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed/challenges-conflicts-and-contests#turn-order) (also known as “elective action order” or “popcorn initiative”) is the default rather than using skills to determine turn order.
- [Advancement](https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed/advancement) functions a little differently; we’ve eliminated significant milestones and finessed major ones (as breakthroughs) to compensate.
- We’ve removed the notion of active opposition as separate from the [defend action](https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed/taking-action-rolling-dice#defend). This has a few minor ripple effects, particularly [overcome’s tie result](https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed/taking-action-rolling-dice#overcome).
- [Create an Advantage](https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed/taking-action-rolling-dice#create-an-advantage) has been tweaked to offer better clarity and agency around the discovery of existing unknown aspects.
- [Full defense](https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed/optional-rules#full-defense) is presented as optional and has been altered a bit to accommodate the expanded scope of the defend action. Other [standard rules options](https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed/optional-rules) are presented as well.
